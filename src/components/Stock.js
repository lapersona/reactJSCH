        detail: 'The IFR-certified GTX 345 looks and operates like a standard Mode S transponder. It fits in the same 1.65-inch high slot in your avionics stack. It boasts a bright, sunlight-readable digital display, a pressure altitude readout, handy timers for approaches and other operations, plus dedicated pushbuttons numbered 0-9 for quick and easy squawk code entry. But where other transponders leave off, the GTX 345 is just getting started. The addition of 1090 MHz ADS-B “Out” transmission capability (using precise GPS-referenced positioning information) enables the transponder to automatically output the more accurate, more dynamic traffic surveillance data that the NextGen airspace system requires. For aircraft that may prefer or require a diversity solution, GTX 345 is available in a diversity configuration which utilizes two antennas — mounted on the top and bottom of the aircraft — to provide superior operational coverage. Plus, available ADS-B “In” reception unlocks even more capabilities for pilots, enabling them to display ADS-B traffic, weather and more on a variety of installed or portable displays.',

        detail: 'The moment you power up GNX 375, you’ll see a familiar Garmin homepage on the 4.8” display, which puts the most important functions within only a few touches. Navigate to dedicated pages for the moving map, traffic, terrain, weather, nearest airports, flight plan, procedures, waypoint information, utilities and more. With shortcuts available to the flight plan and Direct-to functions on almost every page, navigation features are usually just a tap away. Use your finger to pan and zoom on any map, traffic and terrain page. Enter waypoint data with the on-screen keyboard. And touch the home button to get you back to the main page at any time. For added control stability in flight, a shelf across the lower edge of the display serves to steady your hand in smooth and turbulent flight conditions. And if you prefer traditional controls, the concentric knobs provide yet another way to control many of the GNX 375 navigator’s functions.',

        detail: 'The G5 electronic flight instrument delivers exceptional performance, reliability and ease of installation as a drop-in replacement for primary attitude and/or directional gyros in type-certificated fixed-wing aircraft. For select aircraft equipped with G500 or G500 TXi, G5 can also be used as a standby flight instrument to those systems. Providing an economical upgrade path via a comprehensive AML, the compact and cost-effective G5 is bringing modern “glass cockpit” reference to thousands of aircraft that would otherwise depend on older, vacuum-driven equipment.',
